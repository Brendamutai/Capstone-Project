# 6. Data Cleaning
We merged our two datasets, handled missing values and duplicates and standardized our data. This made sure that our data was good enough for further analysis.

# 7. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)
We explored the data using univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis just to see the relationship between different variables. We also checked for outliers and although we identified some, we chose to keep them in the dataset because in the context of stock market data, sudden spikes or drops in price or volume are normal due to market volatility, major news events or investor sentiments. Removing them could result in loss of important information.

# 8. Feature Engineering
We created new features to ensure our models perform better.
